This config file follows the dev enviroment, but adds the
requirement of a celery worker running in the background to process
celery tasks.

When testing locally, run lms/cms with this settings file as well, to test queueing
of tasks onto the appropriate workers.

In two separate processes on devstack:
    paver devstack lms --settings=dev_with_worker
    ./manage.py lms celery worker --settings=dev_with_worker
